Version 1.0 (Mar 24, 1997):
___________________________
Corresponds to the original mfiles (no version number).


Version 1.1 (May 23, 1997):
___________________________
In hmm_fb the scaling procedure was modified to fix a bug:

1) Scaling is performed also when the forward variable becomes too big. In fact
when the original  data is "small", the  forward variable tends to infinity and
not to zero: this could cause overflows in the original version of hmm_fb.

2) The backward variable at time t is scaled by  the scale factor found for the
forward variables at  time  T+1-t (hence the  flipud  operation). This  is just
because using the same scale factors is a good idea since we only need to store
one value for logscale that can be used to compute the likelihood both from the
forward  or  backward variables, however  it  is safer to   use the  same scale
factors for comparable numbers of iterations.

BEWARE THIS IS ACTUALLY A BUG (see below).


Version 1.2  (June  17, 1997):
______________________________
The computation  of gaussian density values  was performed by   a piece of code
that was duplicated in many function. This now  forms a new function gauseval.m
(and gauslogv.m  which  does the same  thing in  log). hmm_fb.m, mix_post.m and
hmm_vit.m have been modified to take this into account. User of MATLAB compiler
should compile gauseval.m  and  gauslogv.m because  it saves  much time.    The
mex-file c_dgaus.c still  exists but is usefull  only for people who don't  use
the compiler (note that the  existence of c_dgaus.mex   is now only checked  in
gauseval.m).


Version 1.3   (July  16, 1997):
_______________________________
In hmm_fb, the scaling is now performed at each  step to avoid uneeded troubles
(this only  slightly slows down the  computation). Version 1.1 introduced a bug
(!)  which has been corrected: using the same scale factors (in hmm_fb) for the
alpha and the beta is needed for the transition matrix reestimation formulas to
be correct.

An important error was corrected  in gauseval and  gauslogv (the version 1.2 of
these functions yielded incorrect results in the case of scalar observations).

multgen is now  called randindx.  There is a  new function called hmm_psim.  vq
can now be used in the case of scalar observations as well.
