<P>
There is a list of the changes that have been made since the first version of this manual (Mar. 18, 1997) in the file <TT>h2m/doc/CHANGES</TT>. The current version number which should be found in all the mfiles is 1.3.
<P>
From a practical point of view, the main changes have been: <EM>(i)</EM> There was an omission in the scaling procedure in the unnumbered version (which could cause overflows when the input data was too small). <EM>(ii)</EM> In versions 1.1 - 1.2, this was corrected but a brand new bug was introduced in the same part of the code (function <TT>hmm_fb</TT>), which prevented a correct re-estimation of the transition matrix.
<P>
Minor changes include: the renaming of <TT>multgen</TT> to <TT>randindx</TT>, and some new functions (<TT>gauseval</TT>, <TT>gauslogv</TT> and <TT>hmm_psim</TT> - see list in section&nbsp;<A HREF="node14.html#listoffunc">7</A>).
