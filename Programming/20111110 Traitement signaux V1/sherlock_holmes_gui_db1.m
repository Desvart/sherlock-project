function varargout = sherlock_holmes_gui_db1(varargin)
% sherlock_holmes_gui_db1 MATLAB code for sherlock_holmes_gui_db1.fig
%      sherlock_holmes_gui_db1, by itself, creates a new sherlock_holmes_gui_db1 or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = sherlock_holmes_gui_db1 returns the handle to a new sherlock_holmes_gui_db1 or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      sherlock_holmes_gui_db1('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in sherlock_holmes_gui_db1.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      sherlock_holmes_gui_db1('Property','Value',...) creates a new sherlock_holmes_gui_db1 or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the sherlock_holmes_gui_db1 before sherlock_holmes_gui_db1_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to sherlock_holmes_gui_db1_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See sherlock_holmes_gui_db1 Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "sherlock_holmes_gui_db1 allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
